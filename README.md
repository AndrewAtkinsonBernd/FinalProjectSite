# Assessing community-needs gaps for resilience hubs in New Orleans



## Research question:
_What are the remaining gaps in emergency & resilience services that communities need in post-Katrina New Orleans?_

In this project we’re looking at access to different emergency resources in New Orleans neighborhoods as a way of showing disparities between high-income, high resource communities and low-income, low-resource communities (and those in between). By focusing on specific service centers like grocery stores, hospitals, and school, which are incredibly important during and following a natural disaster, we hope to show the need for disaster service hubs in underserved areas, as well as what types of services are missing and where might be the most effective location for them. We looked at the overlap of income and resource availability as well building out network maps for the areas most and least accessible to particular emergency-related services (as well as services broadly).

While the research question itself was fairly straightforward, finding the right data and validating it with actual human behavior is incredibly complex. That is, just because we are mapping grocery stores, doesn't mean that is where residents may look to for food in emergency situations–it may be a church, a food bank, or something else entirely. There is a fundamental gap between services currently provided, services people think they need, and services people actually need. 
We attempted to address this through google search trends, which proved interesting but largely less helpful than we hoped. Part of this was that the manual nature of searching doesn’t readily take into account how humans think or search. That is, where our food and water proxy is a grocery store, they may search for “bottled water”, “relief”, or “FEMA” rather than “grocery store”. This will necessitate some assumptions on our part in interpreting indirectly-related searches, in that “bottled water” should likely signify simply needing clean water, not a specific desire for bottled water per se. We had hoped to validate our map data findings against essentially consumer behavior and the ways New Orleans residents were searching for services, but this did not bear fruit. Given the different between what our maps show people need and what people seem to think they need through common searches, it is also important to note that this may validate a different need to do flood and hurricane education, lest residents’ understanding be detached from reality. 

In comparing what people actually have access to and what they actually want (or think they need) access to, we can attempt to bridge the gap between institutions and communities in easily actionable ways.
